# React Ecosystem Strengths

I didn't choose React due to curiosity, but it taught me a lot about the advantages of using a more established framework.

## Libraries

-   Libraries are a widely cited reason to use React but with my limited experience doing frontend intensive work I didn't fully comprehend the power a strong ecosystem provides.

-   This app is a thick-client style app (as opposed to a thin-client app where most interactions simply send a request to the server) and requires rich-interactivity. The lack of pre-built solutions led me to focus on work that enabled me to deliver the business value, rather then directly being able to iterate on the product.

-   For a motivated & experienced dev team, this can be handled, but with a less experienced or motivated team, productivity takes a hit.

-   I learned as a take-way, sticking to tools with significant support & a strong ecosystem provides a significant advantage for any professional or commercial venture by saving time & money.
